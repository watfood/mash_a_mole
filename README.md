# mash_a_mole
Whack–a–molé is a fun, quick version of Whack–a–mole for the family! When you play, there is a grid of 9 cells. An avocado appears randomly in some of these cells (one avocado at a time). When you click on the avocado it gets "mashed" into guacamolé! Once you've mashed the grid full of guacamolé you win the game!
